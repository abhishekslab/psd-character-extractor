## What is PSD Character Extractor?

PSD Character Extractor is a specialized tool designed to analyze and extract character expressions from layered Photoshop (PSD/PSB) files. It's particularly useful for:

- **VTuber Applications**: Extract lip sync expressions for real-time streaming
- **Game Development**: Generate character assets for dialogue systems
- **Animation Projects**: Extract expressions for 2D character animation
- **Interactive Media**: Create expression sets for chatbots and virtual assistants

## Key Features

### üîç **Intelligent Analysis**
- Automatically detects expression layers using keyword matching
- Analyzes PSD structure and layer organization
- Identifies potential lip sync states and mappings

### üé≠ **Expression Extraction**
- Maps expressions to standard lip sync states (closed, small, medium, wide)
- Supports custom expression mapping via JSON configuration
- Extracts full character composites with selected expressions

### üöÄ **Batch Processing**
- Process multiple PSD files simultaneously
- Multi-threaded extraction for improved performance
- Comprehensive progress tracking and error reporting

### üé® **Image Optimization**
- Web-optimized output with configurable quality settings
- VTuber-specific optimization presets
- Multiple output formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- Automatic resizing with aspect ratio preservation

### üíª **CLI & Python API**
- Comprehensive command-line interface with colored output
- Full Python API for integration into existing workflows
- Detailed logging and error reporting

## Architecture Overview

```
PSD Character Extractor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analyzer          # PSD structure analysis and layer detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extractor          # Expression extraction and compositing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Optimizer          # Image optimization and format conversion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Batch Processor    # Multi-file processing workflows
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLI Interface      # Command-line tools and user interaction
```

## Common Use Cases

### VTuber Setup
Extract lip sync expressions for real-time streaming applications:

```bash
# Extract all lip sync states
psd-extract character.psd --output ./vtuber-assets --format png

# Create optimized VTuber assets
psd-extract character.psd --output ./stream --optimize
```

### Game Development
Process multiple characters for a game project:

```bash
# Batch process all characters
psd-batch ./characters --output ./game-assets --workers 6 --report

# Use custom expression mapping
psd-extract character.psd --mapping ./custom-expressions.json
```

### Animation Pipeline
Extract all available expressions for animation work:

```bash
# Analyze character structure first
psd-analyze character.psd --detailed --output analysis.json

# Extract all expressions
psd-list-expressions character.psd
```
